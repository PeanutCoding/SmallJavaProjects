How to do:

If you want normal characters translated into morse code, simply put in your text or message
and hit the alphabet button.

If you have morse code and want it translated into normal characters, put in the text field below
and hit the morse button.

The morse has a special layout, and if you do not stick to this convention,
all you will get is a [Not found] string.
After each letter in morse, i. e.

.- = a

put a qutoation mark after the end of the morse representation.
the following will produce the word "hello"

....'.'.-..'.-..'---'/
