# SmallJavaProjects
Just some small projects to get some coding training done


MorseCode:

This is a somewhat simple morse code converter.
Currently it works only in one direction, namely from
a normal input string to morse code. I am working on a bidirectional approach,
however, this takes some more time and thought.

I have created this program with an xml file since it is a good exercise what can be
done with this file format.


11.08.2022:

The converter is now available as a small Android application, one-directional.
The file "app-debug".apk allows your Android device to install this app. So far
it is not available in the Google Playstore, thus a warning might occur due to 
unknown sources, this is to inform you about that installing this app comes withyour own risk.

I have developed this small project in order to show that I am able to dive unsupervised into new topics about programming. Moreover, this app ought show a quick overview of several different skills, including working with an IDE, xml files, implementing own classes in a new framework and being able to understand and follow the logic of new topics.

This project is not completely done, I am working on extra features such as a bidirecitonal translation, but all in all, this is a working application.`
